<b>Bdc</b> is an app created to take the attendance of a group of friends who meet daily in a common place.<br> 
It was born as a way to avoid using excel files, time sheets or things like that.
The app is designed to be used by a single administrator who manages the attendance of all users and shares them with others, via a pdf that can be filtered by time frame.<br>
Over time, many specific features have been added, many of which are still in the works, such as attendance difficulties, confetti to celebrate 100% attendance in a given period and the inability to register attendance on holidays.<br>
The app is fully developed in <b>Swift (UIKit)</b>, it doesn't have any networking and all the attendance are saved using <b>CoreData</b>. All the design is made entirly using Figma and sometimes Sketch.
